# XML-translator

`XML-translator` is a tiny `Bash` script hack to demonstrate how [`xmlstarlet`](http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/) can be used with online translator (e.g. [Google Translator](http://translate.google.com/)) to translate **arbitrary XML files** easily.

# Dependencies

* [`xmlstarlet`](http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/): command line XML toolkit ;
* [Google Translator](http://translate.google.com/): Google's free online language translation service instantly translates text. The service _can be disrupted or break compatibility_ without notice.

## Disclaimer
If you want to use this script you should **be aware that's it's a hack using [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/)**, and shouldn't be considered as a real solution.

You should also be aware that Google provide a [Translation API](https://developers.google.com/translate/) as a paid service.
